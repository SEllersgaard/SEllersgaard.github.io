Versatile quantitative researcher with a background in mathematical finance, theoretical physics, and analytic philosophy (PhD MSc MASt MPhysPhil). 
Educated at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, and Copenhagen, with a proven track record of academic excellence. Buy and sell side experience
from Brevan Howard, Tudor Capital, and J.P. Morgan. Profound interest in the
full spectrum of financial engineering; from the model driven pricing of exotics, to
the data-driven extraction of alpha-capturing signals. Professional interests gravitate
towards the exploration and integration of classical time series econometrics
and modern-day machine learning to facilitate optimal quantamental trading (signal
research / portfolio construction). Strong proponent of the scientific process.
